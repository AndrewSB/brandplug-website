1) Please replace the 7th influencer image with the png attached called veronica.

2) Replace the first influencer image with the one attached called Matt

3) Please center everything on the mobile version of the site. If you could spread out the social network images on mobile so they show up in rows of 2 or 4 I think that would look best, please do that if you can.

4) Please change the text Who Our Team Has Worked With to "Some Brands Our Team Has With"

5) Please hyperlink the brand logos so they link to these:
www.redbull.com, http://www.ea.com/, http://www.dell.com/, http://www.coolermaster.com, http://www.astrogaming.com/

6) Please take out the razer logo and replace it with the dell logo attached here

7) Please change the 8th image to the one attached titled streamer house

8) Please change the title of the website that shows up at the top of the browser where the website tab is to Brandplug - Inexpensive, Simple, and Effective Celebrity Marketing

9) This one's sort of two requests: Please add name/pseudonym of each influencer centered towards the top of the picture in bold using on of the LATO fonts or something else you think looks better AS WELL AS the text "Primary Network" and a logo of what social network is their primary network that is hyperlinked to that account of there's.
